## **Download Repository**
1. Open your terminal.
2. Make sure you have installed git to clone this repository. If you don't have git installed in your device, you can refer [HERE](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
3. Run this command in your terminal:-\n
   `git clone https://github.com/Umxrx/apollution-detector.git`

## **Change Directory**
1. Change your directory to the cloned repository by running this command in your terminal:-\n
   `cd apollution-detector/build/`\n
   You will definitely go to the path that contains all the source code for this project.
2. If you want to check all of the files and directories in this path, just simply run this command in your terminal:-\n
   `dir`\n
   **NOTE: If you are using Operating System other than Windows, it'll not be useful.**

## **Install All Requirements**
1. Install all of the requirements by simply running this command in your terminal:-\n
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n
   This command should install all of the requirements that will be used in this project.

## **Edit GUI File**
1. Before you run the code, you **MUST** edit your gui.py file first.\n
   In order to access all of the required images in the GUI, you must copy the PATH of 'frame0' (you can see the file [HERE](https://github.com/Umxrx/apollution-detector/tree/main/build/assets/frame0)) and paste it in this segment to change the default PATH in **gui.py - Line 18**:-\n
   ![](https://github.com/Umxrx/apollution-detector/blob/main/Images/Should-be-changed.jpg)\n
   The path should look like this:-\n
   `C:\Users\Username\Your_Path\Your_Path\apollution-detector\build\assets\frame0`

## **Run GUI File**
1. Finally, you can run the gui.py python application using this command:-\n
   `python gui.py`
2. Later, you don't have to repeat the same step to run this code again. You can just follow these two (2) steps only ([Step 1](https://github.com/Umxrx/apollution-detector/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#change-directory) and [Step 2](https://github.com/Umxrx/apollution-detector/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#run-gui-file)).
